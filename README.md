 # Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
We built an application that generates motivational posters, and it turns those frowns upside down! It also allows you to create your own posters and save any other poster that you generated.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

- Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
- In your forked GitHub repository, click the code drop-down menu and copy the SSH key.

#### Option 1

- Open the terminal on your machine and navigate to the containing directory you’d like - to clone the repository folder and its contents to. On the command line, run “git clone” + the SSH key you copied earlier. A new folder will be created containing a local copy of the repository linked to the forked repository you created - enter the new directory. On the command line, run “open index.html”.

#### Option 2

- In the forked repository you created, open the “Settings” tab and select “Pages” on the left pane. Under “Build and Deployment”, select “Deploy from a Branch” within the “Source” drop-down menu. Under “Branch”, select the “main” branch in the drop-down menu and hit the “Save” button. On the right-hand side of the main page of your repository, find the “Environments” section and click the link for “github-pages” - this may take some time to load at first. In the following page, hit the “View Deployment” button to view the site.
